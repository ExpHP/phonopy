'force-fit' requires to merge the master (develop) and phono4py branches.
'phono4py' requires to merge the master (develop) branch.

Therefore the procedure to make it work is,

1. In the phono4py branch, merge the develop branch and make it work to catch up the latest changes.
2. In the force-fit branch, merge the phono4py branch and make it work to catch up the latest changes.
3. Run setup.py, setup4.py, and setup_ff.py.
